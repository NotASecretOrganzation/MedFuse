Kevin said he liked stories. Here is story: A person was making money based on the number of photos submitted to the company. I suspect that this person had their entire family upload photos through a Blazor Server app, possibly by opening multiple tabs. I can’t remember if it was the company’s own wrapper or the Face API they used that wasn’t thread-safe. 

We made it single-threaded to keep it thread-safe, since accuracy was important for ensuring the correct doctor was identified. I helped two coworkers improve performance by making the process asynchronous at first, but the narcissist thought we made it slower afterward. 

Their performance during the review wasn’t good, and they believed we were the ones who got them fired. Meanwhile, the CEO wasn’t focused on the project because they wanted to sell insurance data for their own benefit. Also, when a person does sketchy thing, why do they always tell people they are doing sketchy thing? Eigenface. Reminding me of the two Wet Bandits. 

A person was making money based on the number of photos submitted to the company. I suspect this person had their whole family upload photos through a Blazor Server app, possibly by opening multiple tabs to inflate the count. 

Originally, the system was very slow during development, and I helped make it faster by introducing asynchronous processing. Later, however, we had to slow it down again to make it thread-safe and compliant with HIPAA-like privacy and safety standards, since it involved identifying the correct doctor through facial recognition. Plus 

I can’t remember if it was the company’s wrapper or the Face API that wasn’t thread-safe, but ensuring accuracy was the priority. The narcissist, though, thought we made it slower afterward and blamed us for their poor performance review. They even believed we were the reason they got fired. 

Meanwhile, the CEO wasn’t paying much attention to the project, being more focused on selling insurance data for their own goods. And, as always, when someone does something sketchy, they tend to announce it proudly, almost like leaving a calling card—kind of like the Wet Bandits from Home Alone.
